GDNative main Actor base class and Player class implementations for **_They Came From Dimension X_**.

The Actor class is a bit hefty, needs a lot of optimization. Definitely the most complex class in the whole game. Does some cool things though that can hopefully help or inspire, and I like sharing the wealth if I can (_and maybe get some help optimizing it lol_).

Player class does some cool things, too, and kind of helps serve as an example for how the physics are managed. The Actor class itself doesn't really make any navigation calls; the Actor sub-classes do.

Anyway, I hope you find this useful! Happy game dev'ing!
