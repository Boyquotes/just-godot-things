Godot 4 GDExtension management class to handle player input. Supports keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input, as well as remapping to most keys.

Add to your GDExtension C++ project. Action map is defined in ControlsMgr.h, no need to modify ControlsMgr.cpp. In Godot, add the GD script as an Autoload Singleton.

Hope you find this helpful!   :)
