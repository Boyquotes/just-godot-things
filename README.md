# just-godot-things
Various classes and shaders made for use with the Godot Engine. These files aren't quite drag'n'drop / plug'n'play ready: for the GDNative versions
you'll need to compile them as part of a GDNative plugin for your project and create the necessary GDNS files for them. The GDScript versions can be 
dropped in without too much trouble but you'll need to make sure the scenes point to the correct script locations. Think of these more as examples of 
what you can do with Godot, and how you might do it for your own projects.
